### Project Explanation: Student Dashboard

#### Objective
The objective of this project is to create a web page that displays a list of students in a tabular format based on the given design.

#### Technologies Used
1. **HTML:** For the structure of the web page.
2. **CSS:** For styling the web page to match the design.
3. **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity and dynamically displaying the list of students.

#### Steps Taken

1. **Setting Up the Project:**
   - Created a folder named `student-dashboard`.
   - Inside the folder, created three files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `scripts.js`.

2. **HTML (index.html):**
   - Structured the page with a sidebar, a header, a search bar, and a table for displaying students.
   - Linked the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file for interactivity.

3. **CSS (styles.css):**
   - Applied styles to make the sidebar, header, and table look nice and clean.
   - Used CSS classes to handle the layout, colors, and fonts to ensure the page looks similar to the provided design.

4. **JavaScript (scripts.js):**
   - Created an array of student objects to use as dummy data.
   - Wrote functions to display the students in the table and to handle pagination.
   - Added an event listener for the search bar to filter students based on the input.
   - Displayed the students and pagination buttons dynamically by manipulating the DOM.

#### Key Features Implemented
1. **Student Table:**
   - Displays students' information such as photo, ID, name, email, phone number, and year group.

2. **Search Functionality:**
   - Allows users to search for students by their first or last name.

3. **Pagination:**
   - Divides the student list into pages and allows users to navigate between them.

#### Running the Project
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The page will display a list of students with a sidebar and header.
3. Use the search bar to filter students by name.
4. Navigate through pages using the pagination buttons at the bottom.
